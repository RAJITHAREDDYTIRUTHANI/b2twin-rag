As an environmental analyst for Biosphere 2, here's my analysis of the fan sensor data:

Summary:
- The data covers a 5-hour period from 00:00 to 04:45 on September 21, 2025
- Readings are taken at 15-minute intervals
- All values are consistently 0
- Status code is consistently 32 with "overridden" status tag
- No trend flags are active (all 0)

Anomalies:
The most concerning observation is that all fan readings are 0 with an "overridden" status. This suggests:
1. The fan system is completely inactive
2. The control system has been manually overridden
3. There may be a sensor malfunction or calibration issue

Ecosystem Health Interpretation:
This situation requires IMMEDIATE ATTENTION. Having no fan operation for over 4 hours is potentially dangerous because:
- Air circulation is crucial for proper atmospheric mixing
- Lack of air movement can lead to:
  * Stagnant air pockets
  * Poor CO2/O2 exchange
  * Irregular temperature distribution
  * Potential humidity buildup

Recommendation:
- Investigate why the system is overridden
- Check fan hardware for mechanical issues
- Verify sensor functionality
- Restore normal fan operation as soon as possible if no intentional override is in place

This situation could impact ecosystem stability if not addressed promptly.
