Let me analyze this temperature data from Biosphere 2:

Summary:
- The data covers a 4.75 hour period from midnight to 4:45 AM on Sept 21, 2025
- Temperature shows a consistent gradual cooling trend throughout the night
- Starting temperature: 77.21°F (at midnight)
- Ending temperature: 75.92°F (at 4:45 AM)
- Total temperature drop: ~1.29°F
- Average cooling rate: approximately 0.27°F per hour

Anomalies:
- No concerning anomalies detected
- All readings show expected gradual nighttime cooling
- No sudden spikes or drops that would indicate sensor malfunction
- All status tags show "ok" indicating reliable readings

Ecosystem Health Interpretation:
This data suggests healthy and stable environmental conditions:
- The gradual nighttime temperature decline is natural and expected
- The cooling rate is moderate and steady, which is good for ecosystem stability
- Temperature remains within a comfortable range for most organisms (75-78°F)
- The smooth transition suggests proper thermal regulation within the facility
- No concerning fluctuations that might stress the ecosystem

Overall, based on this temperature data alone, the environmental conditions appear stable and well-maintained, supporting a healthy ecosystem during this nighttime period.
